# Network-Automation
Network automation with Python and Secure_CRT scripts.

There are a python file that you should run from Secure_CRT : m_inventory_report and it then fetches the csv file named: Devices. In this csv file there are all the IP's of the switches and routers that you want to run the script from which includes the username, protocol and passwords of all the devices. You will need to be connected via VPN or just able to ping the devices before running this script.
